### Namaste hackers,

I identify myself as `hacker`.

I work professionally as a `Full-Stack Web Application Developer`.

- 💻 I also contribute in Open Source and I learnt it is the best way to advance your skills
- I talk 🐍 `python`, write 🖊️`Go`, read ☑️`TypeScript` and joke in 😆`JavaScript` and I don't know why I put this into my bio.
- I am trying to beat Elon Musk on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rajritu001) and I act professionally on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rituraj001/)
